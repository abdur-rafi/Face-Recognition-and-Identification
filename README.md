# Face Identification

Face recognition and identification.

Used models 
1. MTCNN -> For extracting faces
2. Google's Facenet -> For converting faces to vectors
3. Triplet Loss -> For finetuning Facenet with own dataset

The dataset used is collected from facebook posts of my friends and family. So the dataset is kept private.
